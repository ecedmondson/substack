## Library Management 

Library Management is a hastily thrown together django app intended to demonstrate a prodution bug 
I wrote in a previous role. As such, I very intentionally added a bug (in the serializer code), and
very intentionally _did not really think too deeply_ about anything else. This code should not be considered
production-ready or representative of a django app with best practices.
